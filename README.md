# Specification With Repository Pattern

This implementation of the Specification pattern is based on the Ardalis implementation. Combined with the repository pattern using a generic repository, this implemntation greatly reduces boilerplate code typical for Get and CRUD operations. 

In this implementation, it comes at the cost of NOT adhering strictly to the Single Reposibility Principle in regards to the Generic Repositories.
